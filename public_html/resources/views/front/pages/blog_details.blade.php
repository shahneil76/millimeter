                        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                        leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                        with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
